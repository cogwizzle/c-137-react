# C-137 React
C-137 React is a Rick and Morty inspired Sci-Fi component library.  It is specifically loosely based on the user interface seen in Rick's ship in the keep summer safe scene of the TV show.  Currently the existing version is a prototype and I will be elaborating more on some components and makig it a bit more like it was inside of the show.
